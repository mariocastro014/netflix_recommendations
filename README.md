Movie Recommendation Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to develop a program which can recommend a short list of movies after the user has made a movie choice. The exercise will use the data form grouplens that you can find in this link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/. This is a zip file with several files inside. Your work should be based on u.data. You can use at your discretion the files ux.base and ux.test (x in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, a, b). for evaluation purposes.

The system should be able to return a list of recommendations given one user Id. The system should look for n users similar to the given user and return the movies with the highest average scores (of course, we will not take the movies already rated by the given user). You should provide at least three examples of this behavior.

In this assignment you only have to complete the code in the notebook provided with this assignment

Content of your work:
•	A python notebook with all the code and explanations
•	The code should provide at least 3 examples how the system makes recommendations
